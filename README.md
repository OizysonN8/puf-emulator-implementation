# puf-emulator-implementation
Final project for INFO 415 Special Topics in Cybersecurity: Cyber Resilience. This project is set to include a PUF implementation from the PyPUF library, a machine learning algorithm from the PyPUF library, a deep learning algorithm implemented using either PyTorch or Tensorflow, and finally a HW implementation of a PUF on a RPi Zero 2 W.
